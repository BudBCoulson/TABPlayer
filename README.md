# TABPlayer
A system to parse and play ASCII guitar tabs.

The parser reads an ASCII guitar tab and converts it into an encoded sequence of notes (together with any special playing techniques used: slides, bends, muting, etc.)

The player generates sounds corresponding to the played notes using NumPy and simpleaudio.
